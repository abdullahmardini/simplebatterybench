# What is this?
I just want to know if the different battery tuning stuff, i.e. `ppd` vs `tlp` vs `tuneD` actually make any difference, and if there's a difference between them.
Note that your particular laptop model will matter a lot, depending on firmware bugs and how that responds to different tuning knobs. It looks like the defaults are fantastic on Thinkpads.

# TODO
* Improve the sleep check. AMD has a script that measures how long you were actually in s2idle, I should probably figure out how they do that and take inspiration / shameless plagiarize.
* Improve the wake check. Need to prevent suspend in the actual script, improve the wake and idle parts. I ran this with my browser open.

# What did I get?
